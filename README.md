📚 Book Recommendation System (Deep Learning Approach)
Project Overview
This project implements a personalized book recommendation system leveraging Deep Learning techniques. Specifically, it uses collaborative filtering methods, mapping users and books into a latent feature space to predict user preferences and suggest highly relevant books.

The system addresses the challenge of providing accurate recommendations in a sparse dataset, often found in large-scale catalog systems.

Key Features:
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes an architecture (e.g., SBERT model) for efficient feature learning.

Data Processing: Includes robust data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling of explicit/implicit feedback.

Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics relevant to recommendation systems
